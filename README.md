# A-neural-network-based-MNIST-digit-classifier-in-TensorFlow
MNIST is a dataset that contains 70,000 labelled images of handwritten digits.
Weâ€™re going to train a neural network on a part of this dataset, and test it against another portion of the dataset to see how well we did.
We get an accuracy of 96% which is pretty fine!
